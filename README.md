# Pain Study


## Backend

The backend is implemented using the **FastAPI** package in **Python**. To run the `main.py` file:  
1. **Install all required packages** as mentioned in the main.py.  
2. Execute the following command in the terminal:  
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload


## Frontend

The frontend is developed using **Vue**, a JavaScript-based framework. To run the application:  
1. Open a terminal in the frontend directory.  
2. Execute the following command:  
   ```bash
   npm run serve


## Suggestions for testing

To facilitate testing and frontend improvements, I have included one example for each question type to demonstrate the different types of questions.

Question 1 is a **multi-choice question**:
   - If you select any of the first three options, it will redirect to a **VAS question**.  
   - If you select the last option, it will redirect to a **text question**. After the text question, the flow will proceed to a **BMI question**.



Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
